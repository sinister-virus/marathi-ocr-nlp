# marathi-ocr-nlp
This project implements handwritten text recognition using OCR and NLP, focusing on Marathi text. The goal is to extract and process text from scanned Marathi documents and perform NLP tasks such as tokenization and language detection. This is part of my SII P3 NLP - TA 2 Assignment for M.Tech AIDS at NFSU.
